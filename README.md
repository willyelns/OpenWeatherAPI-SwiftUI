# OpenWeatherAPI SwiftUI

An iOS Application using SwiftUI and MVVM to create a Base Architecture to create apps.


## Motivation

When Apple launched the SwiftUI the pattern to create apps in iOS was changed to [MVVM](https://www.raywenderlich.com/34-design-patterns-by-tutorials-mvvm), and because of it, I started to read more about it and I found this [great article](https://www.raywenderlich.com/4161005-mvvm-with-combine-tutorial-for-ios).
Using the project provided by the article as a base, I created my architecture based on MVVM with some concepts of Clean Architecture.

This project is just a practical example. In the future, I'll do a blank template.


## TODO

* Template Project 
* Add new targets - *Apple Watch*
